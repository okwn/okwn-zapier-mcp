# Zapier Plugin

Connect 8,000+ apps to your AI workflow. Configure your actions at mcp.zapier.com, and each one becomes a tool your AI can call directly — no config files, no tokens, no setup scripts.

## Quick Start

After installing, open a chat and say **"setup zapier"**. The onboarding skill will:

1. Check your connection status
2. Walk you through authenticating your Zapier account
3. Help you pick the right tools for your workflow
4. Generate a personalized AI profile so future chats know your tools

## What's Included

| Component                         | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **zapier-lifecycle** rule         | Enforces the safety model for reads vs writes, duplicate detection with native MCP servers, and error handling. Always active.                                    |
| **zapier-setup** skill            | Onboarding and connection management. Diagnoses your setup, branches into the right flow (fresh install, reconnect, add tools), and walks you through end-to-end. |
| **zapier-status** skill           | Three modes: health check (dashboard of connected tools), audit (find duplicates and waste), diagnose (systematic troubleshooting).                               |
| **create-my-tools-profile** skill | Scans your configured action tools and generates a personalized tools profile so your AI knows what tools you have and when to use them.                          |

## How Tools Work

The plugin connects to Zapier's MCP server. Each action you configure at [mcp.zapier.com](https://mcp.zapier.com) becomes its own MCP tool, named with the pattern `app_action_name`:

- **`gmail_send_email`** — Send an email via Gmail
- **`slack_find_message`** — Search for a Slack message
- **`jira_create_issue`** — Create a Jira issue
- **`google_calendar_find_events`** — Look up calendar events

There is also one built-in tool:

- **`get_configuration_url`** — Returns the URL to manage your actions (add, remove, authenticate)
